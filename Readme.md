## The challenge

Letâ€™s use what weâ€™ve learned and take a chance to continue practicing DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a simple restaurant homepage! By the end, we are going to be using JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website!

**Note: DOM elements should be created using JavaScript but styling can be done in a separate CSS file.**
